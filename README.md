# Cost Optimization for Large-Scale Data Operations

A comprehensive guide to reducing AI costs by up to 72% when processing large volumes of data with Claude and other LLMs.

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed guide on optimizing AI model costs for enterprises processing millions of requests. The guide demonstrates how to reduce annual AI costs from $3,960,000 to $1,122,951 through systematic optimization techniques.

## Key Optimization Layers

1. **Data Preparation** - 23% cost reduction through intelligent token management
2. **Prompt Caching & Batch Processing** - 24% additional savings  
3. **Query Grouping** - Efficient request batching for shared contexts
4. **Model Selection** - 51% savings by routing to appropriate models
5. **Advanced Techniques** - PTUs and model distillation

## Getting Started

## Example Use Case

The guide uses a security operations center processing 1 million log analysis requests monthly as a baseline, with each request analyzing 100,000 input tokens (approximately 750 security logs).

## Key Takeaways

- Model selection is the biggest cost optimization lever for high-volume operations
- Optimizations compound - implement multiple layers for maximum savings
- Balance cost reduction with performance requirements
